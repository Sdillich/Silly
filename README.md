# Runpod Serverless Proxy

This is a FastAPI application providing an OpenAI-compatible API for sporadic text generation using models hosted on [Runpod](https://runpod.io?ref=rql9o4ou) serverless infrastructure. It is not recommended for batch jobs or tasks with large run times.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- FastAPI
- A Runpod serverless endpoint running `runpod/worker-vllm:0.2.3`. See the [Setup Guide](./docs/runpod_endpoint.md) for instructions on setting this up.
- **New**: Optionally use `registry.gitlab.com/dannysemi/worker-vllm:eager_mode` worker for access to `enforce_eager` flag. This flag frees up vram occupied by CUDA graphs at the expense of execution speed. Overall quality remains the same.
- **New**: Use `registry.gitlab.com/dannysemi/worker-embeddings:0.1.7` for generating embeddings. `MODEL_NAME` should be any SentenceTransformer-compatible model on HuggingFace.

### New guides for SillyTavern and hf-pre-downloader

- [hf-pre-downloader](./docs/hf_pre_downloader.md) - Reduce initial execution time on your endpoint by downloading the model files to the network volume using a pod in advance.
- [LoneStriker/MiquMaid-v2-70B-DPO-GPTQ guide](./docs/miqumaid_guide.md) - Complete guide to setting up this endpoint and accessing it through SillyTavern UI.
- [TheBloke/Goliath-longLORA-120b-rope8-32k-fp16-AWQ](./docs/goliath_guide.md) - Very similar to the MiquMaid guide, but uses 2x A40s in the configuration.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

### Usage

The application provides the following API endpoints which mirror the OpenAI api:

- `POST /chat/completions`: Generate a chat completion
- `POST /completions`: Generate a completion (Note: streaming does not work for this endpoint.)
- `POST /embeddings`: Generate embeddings **NEW!**
- `GET /models`: List all models
- `GET /models/{model_id}`: Get a specific model

To start the application, you can use the following command:

`python main.py --config "/path/to/config/file"`

You can also specify different parameters using command line arguments:

- `-c` or `--config`: Path to the config file. If this is provided, the application will load configurations from the specified file.
- `-e` or `--endpoint`: API endpoint ID. This is mandatory if not loading from a config file. An alphanumeric string that should be found on the endpoint details for your Runpod serverless endpoint.
- `-k` or `--api_key`: API key. This is mandatory if not loading from a config file. This is your Runpod API key.
- `-m` or `--model`: Model name. This is mandatory if not loading from a config file. Used for routing requests to a specific worker. You can choose to name your models whatever you want. This is how you will reference them in the api or in menus with connected apps. Note: you can have multiple models/runpod endpoints if using a config file.
- `-t` or `--timeout`: Timeout. *Default: 150*. Time in seconds before this app sends a request to cancel the job through runpod's api.
- `-o` or `--use_openai_format`: Use OpenAI format. *Default: 1*. Tells the api to attempt to send the job as an OpenAI chat completion. Will fail if the model is not configured to handle messages (should have a chat template in its config)
- `-b` or `--batch_size`: Batch size. *Default: 30*.
- `--host`: Host. *Default: 127.0.0.1*
- `--port`: Port. *Default: 3000*

If not loading from a config file, the `--endpoint`, `--api_key`, and `--model` arguments are mandatory. If any of these arguments are missing, the application will not start.

An example config file can be copied from `config.example.json` found in the root directory of this repo.

For example:

```bash
python main.py --endpoint "my_endpoint" --api_key "my_api_key" --model "my_model" --timeout 30 --use_openai_format 1 --batch_size 10 --host "0.0.0.0" --port 8000
```
